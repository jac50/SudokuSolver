Sudoku Solver Version 1
=======================

Introduction
------------

This is a program written in C designed to solve 9x9 sudoku puzzles. I wrote this program primarily to learn how to program in C, but also as a way of checking answers of puzzles. The bulk of the code was written in October 2010 during my second year of university. 

Method
------

Testing
-------

To test the solver:

+ Use some of the provided puzzles in PuzzlesToTest
+ To make your own, simply create a .txt file with the puzzle stored in 9 lines of 9 numbers. Spaces aren't required between lines or numbers. Use a '0' to denote a blank.
+ Rename this file Puzzle.txt and ensure that it is in the same directory as the compiled program.
+ Run the solver, and it will output both the initial puzzle and the solution.
